## Supported platforms

<p class="description">Learn about the platforms, from modern to old, that are supported by react-swipeable-views.</p>

The API is as consistent as possible between the three platforms so
the same component can be used independently on where it's running.

### Browser

| IE    | Edge | Windows Phone | Firefox | Chrome | Safari |
|:------|:-----|:--------------|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| >= 10 | âœ“    | x             | >= 28   | >= 29  | >= 8   |

#### Legacy browser support

react-swipeable-views supports modern browsers out-of-the-box, but requires additional CSS to support legacy browsers. To support IE 10 and older versions of Mobile Safari, include `react-swipeable-views/dist/legacy-browser-support.css`.
